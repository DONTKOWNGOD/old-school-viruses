# The Old School Virus Collection
This is a collection of really old (mid 90s) virus source code that you can use for research. It's highly unlikely anything here will be able to do any damage to modern systems, but on that note, I am not suggesting you use the sources here to undertake illegal activities, I am providing these purely for educational purposes.

Enjoy!
